# AzGovViz - Azure Governance Visualizer

Do you want to have visibility on your Tenant´s Management Group hierarchy - document it in csv, html and markdown?  
AzGovViz is a PowerShell based script that iterates your Azure Tenants Management Group hierarchy down to Subscription level. It captures most relevant Azure governance capabilities such as Azure Policy, RBAC and Blueprints and more. From the collected data AzGovViz provides visibility on your Hierarchy Map, creates a Tenant Summary and builds granular Scope Insights on Management Groups and Subscriptions. The technical requirements as well as the required permissions are minimal.

You can run the script either for your Tenant Root Group or any other Management Group that you have read access on.

#### Azure DevOps Pipeline

The provided example Pipeline is configured to run based on a [shedule](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/build/triggers?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml#scheduled-triggers) (every 6 hours). It will push the AzGovViz markdown output file to the 'wiki' folder in the 'Azure-MG-Sub-Governance-Reporting' Repository which will feed your Wiki.

1. In Azure DevOps make sure to [enable](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/project/navigation/preview-features?view=azure-devops&tabs=new-account-enabled) the Multistage Pipelines feature <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/get-started/multi-stage-pipelines-experience?view=azure-devops>
2. Clone the AzGovViz Repo
3. Create Pipeline, configure your pipeline selecting __Existing Azure Pipelines YAML file__, select the AzGovViz YAML from the AzGovViz (Azure-MG-Sub-Governance-Reporting) Repo
4. Permissions: In order to allow the pipeline to push files back to our 'wiki' folder in the 'Azure-MG-Sub-Governance-Reporting' Repository the __Build Service__ ('%ProjectName% Build Service (%OrgName%)') must be granted __Contribute__ and __Create Branch__ permissions
5. Run the Pipeline
6. Create Wiki by choosing [Publish Code as Wiki](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/project/wiki/publish-repo-to-wiki?view=azure-devops&tabs=browser), define the folder 'wiki' from the 'Azure-MG-Sub-Governance-Reporting' Repository as source


> Make sure your Service Connection has the required permissions (see __Required permissions in Azure__).

### Security

AzGovViz creates very detailed information about your Azure Governance setup. In your organizations best interest the outputs __should be protected from not authorized access!__

### Facts

Subscriptions where QuotaId starts with with "AAD_" are being skipped, all others are queried (<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/understand-cost-mgt-data#supported-microsoft-azure-offers>).  

Limits are not acquired programmatically, they are hardcoded. The links used to check related Limits are commented in the param section of the script.
